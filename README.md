# AI Debate App

A minimal Next.js app that lets two AIs debate a topic in real‑time.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <your‑repo>
cd ai-debate-app
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # add your OpenAI key
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy to Vercel by importing the repo – the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var must be set in the Vercel dashboard.
